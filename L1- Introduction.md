##Probelm in torch :
1) static computation graph: can't change graph on runtime
2) coded in lula

## PyTorch 1.0
- famous in research
- TorchScrpit: model serialization and optimisation
- caffe2 integration (prod)

## PyTorch 1.x Series
### Key Features:
○ Support for distributed training.
○ ONNX compatibility for interoperability with other frameworks.
○ Introduced quantization for model compression and efficiency.
○ Expanded ecosystem with torchvision (CV), torchtext (NLP), and torchaudio (audio).

### Impact:
○ Increased adoption by the research community and industry.
○ Inspired community libraries like PyTorch Lightning(keras of pytorch, high level api) and Hugging Face Transformers.
○ Strengthened cloud support for easy deployment.

## PyTorch 2.0
## Key Features:
